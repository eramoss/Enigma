# Enigma Machine

The Enigma machine was a cipher machine used primarily by the German military during World War II. And as everyone maybe already seen, was the fuel to race of computer science and criptography

## Overview

The Enigma machine consisted of a series of rotors, a reflector, and a plugboard (in that code, i created the reflactor as a inverse module of Rotors). It operated by passing an electrical signal through the rotors and reflector, which would scramble the input letter into a different letter output and pass again to plugboard. The settings of the rotors and plugboard would determine the encryption algorithm.

## Functionality

1. **Rotors**: The Enigma machine typically used three to five rotors (three in that code), each containing a series of electrical contacts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. These rotors could be set to different positions, changing the substitution cipher used for encryption.

2. **Reflector**: After passing through the rotors, the signal would be reflected back through the rotors again, further scrambling the output. The reflector ensured that the encryption process was reciprocal, meaning the same machine could be used for both encryption and decryption.

3. **Plugboard**: The plugboard allowed for additional customization of the encryption algorithm. It consisted of a series of cables that could be plugged into different sockets, connecting pairs of letters and swapping them before and after passing through the rotors.

4. **Settings**: The key to the Enigma machine's security was the vast number of possible settings. The rotors could be arranged in any order, and each rotor could be set to any starting position. Additionally, the plugboard allowed for further permutation of the letter mappings.

5. **Encryption Process**: To encrypt a message, the operator would input each letter of the plaintext message into the machine one at a time. As each letter was entered, the rotors would advance, changing the encryption algorithm for the next letter. The encrypted message would then be transmitted using Morse code or another form of telecommunication.

6. **Decryption**: Decryption was performed by entering the encrypted message into another Enigma machine configured with the same settings. As the signal passed through the rotors and reflector, the original plaintext message would be revealed.
